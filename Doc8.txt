The sex determining gene SRY has undergone rapid evolution in rodents. Curiously, a new study by Miyawaki et al. reveals that a recently evolved SRY gene sequence antagonizes SRY protein stability, necessitating splicing of a novel intron. Other data suggest that this troublesome gene region has noncoding RNA functions, possibly related to conflict between sex chromosomes.
