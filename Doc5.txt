The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway degrades some but not all mRNAs bearing premature termination codons (PTCs). Decades of work have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of NMD. More recently, statistical analyses of large genomic datasets have allowed the importance of known and novel 'rules of NMD' to be tested and combined into methods that accurately predict whether PTC containing mRNAs are degraded or not. We discuss these genomic approaches and how they can be applied to identify diseases and individuals that may benefit from inhibition or activation of NMD.
