Forkhead box (FOX) proteins belong to an evolutionarily conserved family of transcription factors that has evolved by genome duplication. FOX family members have undergone sequence and regulatory diversification. However, they have retained some degree of functional redundancy, in addition to playing specific roles, both during development and in the adult. Genetic alterations or misregulation of FOX genes underlie human genetic diseases, cancer, and/or aging. In this review, we provide an updated overview of the main characteristics of the members of this family, in terms of breadth of expression, protein domain composition, evolution, and function.
