As exacting as genetic and genomic testing have become, 
health professionals continue to encounter uncertainty in their 
applications to medical practice. As examining the human genome at
 more refined levels increases, so is the likelihood of encountering uncertainty about the meaning of the information. The history of this concept informs how we might confront and deal with uncertainty, and what the future might hold. Precision medicine holds great promise for establishing more accurate diagnoses, directing specific therapy to patients who will most benefit from it, and avoiding treatments in patients who are most likely to suffer adverse consequences, or at best not benefit.
