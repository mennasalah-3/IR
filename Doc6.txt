Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly malignant cerebellar tumor predominantly diagnosed during childhood. Driven by pathogenic activation of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, SHH subgroup MB accounts for nearly one third of diagnoses. Extensive molecular analyses have identified biologically and clinically relevant intertumoral heterogeneity among tumors, prompting the recognition of novel subtypes. Beyond germline and somatic mutations promoting constitutive SHH signaling, driver alterations affect a multitude of pathways and molecular processes, including TP53 signaling, chromatin modulation, and post transcriptional gene regulation.
